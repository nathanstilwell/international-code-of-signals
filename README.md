## International Code of Signals a.k.a. Nautical Flags and what they mean

This is a site app to help me (and maybe you!) learn the Nautical Flags, their use, and meaning. It's
also refresher of what I get out of the box from create-react-app. Perhaps with time I'll replace the
scaffolding, but for now just an experiment.
